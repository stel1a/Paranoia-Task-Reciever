# Paranoia Task Reciever

hello !! this is a side project i made in my spare time for a paranoia ttrpg i am running, so things may be a bit janky.

a lot of the game requires giving players tasks and passing notes to each other. this uses an esc-pos compatable printer to accomplish this with given .md files for some style/flare to my campaign (and it's also a timesaver for me not having to handwrite them manually.)
# Dependancies
* python-escpos (python-escpos[all])
* python-rich (tui)
* readchar

a test.md file is given as an example of how formatting works, and a tutorial is given on startup which guides ya through the basics. here is a screenshot of that!

have fun !! :3c
